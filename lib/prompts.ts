- NotebookLM: best when studying from your own PDFs or notes; supports summaries, mindmaps/podcasts, and Q&A from uploaded sources.
- Perplexity: good for cited web research and comparing sources; always open and read the linked evidence.
- Subject-specific AI (Math/Physics/Chem): best for checking your work and explaining steps; you must verify correctness yourself.
- Gamma: turns notes into presentable slides quickly; edit afterward to keep voice and accuracy.
- Lex: fast drafting with a "continue" feature; useful for revision passes while retaining your style.
- Notion and Zapier: helpful for organization and light automations across projects and reminders.
- Core principles: supplement learning, do not replace it; document process and reflection; keep your own voice; cite and verify sources when researching.`;
